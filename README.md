## What's Next

1. Adding more things to grab like bookmarks, credit cards, extensions, ...
2. Async Funtions
3. Creating an NuGet Package
4. Adding custom Functions that replace the packages
5. Creating a minimalized File that anyone can easily implement in their Project without referencing CockyGrabber itself
6. Migrate to .NET Core / .NET Standart *(maybe)*
7. Creating a better documentation
8. Improving the in-code documentation
9. Making the `UniversalGrabber` less confusing (and improving it in general)

## End

Thats it for now!</br>
